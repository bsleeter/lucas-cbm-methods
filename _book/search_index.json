Figure 3.1 shows the estimated net primary productivity (NPP), heterotrophic respiration (Rh), net ecosystem productivity (NEP) and net biome productivity (NBP) over time for each of the four simulations. The size of the net sink varied considerably from year-to-year, ranging from -3 (source) to 242 MMT C yr-1. Climate variability was the primary driver of inter-annual variability in the size of the forest sink. When climate was not included in the simulations, the size of the net sink ranged from 51 to 200 MMT C yr-1 and showed a declining trend over time due to the lack of increased productivity from recent climate conditions. Land use, land-use change, and disturbances were the primary controlling processes effecting the magnitude of the net carbon sink. When LULC was excluded, the forest carbon sink was 49% higher (mean of 278 MMT C yr-1) than simulations where LULC was incorporated. Net primary productivity (NPP) of U.S. forests averaged 1,241 MMT C yr-1. Incorporating the effects of LULC and disturbances reduced total NPP by 50 MMT C yr-1 while incorporating the effects of climate variability and change resulted in an increase in NPP of 12 MMT C yr-1 compared to the LULC only simulation. These results suggest that LULC and disturbance have a negative impact on NPP while climate variability and change between 2001-2020 have resulted in increased productivity of U.S. forests. Heterotrophic respiration (Rh) increased under all simulations resulting from increases in productivity and climate warming. Figure 3.1: Net fluxes of carbon in conterminous U.S. forests for the period 2002-2020. The largest net carbon losses were in found in the mountain regions (Sierra Nevada, Klamath and Cascades ecoregions) of California and Oregon and were largely driven by stand-replacing wildifres (California) and forest harvest (Oregon). While remaining a net sink of carbon, the southeast experienced declines to to high rates of harvest of plantation forests and urbanization. However, the high rates of productivity in the region, along with afforestation, offset carbon losses resulting in a modest net sink. Texas was the state with the largest net sink, largely the result of forest ageing and low rates of stand-replacing disturbances. Figure 3.2: Mean annual net biome productivity (NBP) of conterminous U.S. forests for the period 2002-2020 summarized by ecoregion (a) and states (b). Panel c shows NBP estimated for all forest cells inthe conterminous U.S. Carbon losses from LULC and disturbances reduced the annual forest carbon sink by 83 MMT C yr-1 on average. The cumulative loss of carbon sequestration was primarily from the transfer of carbon to harvest wood products which averaged 68 MMT C yr-1 while carbon losses from combusion - primarily due to wildfire - averaged 14 MMT C yr-1 (Table 3.1). Carbon losses from fire were highly variable from year-to-year. However, the three highest fire emission years all occurred since 2017. In 2020, emissions from fire, including the record setting megafires in California and Oregon, were estimated to be 47.16 MMT C (173.06 MMT CO2), more then three times the historical average. In addition to ecosystem carbon removals, LULC and disturbances resulted in the transfer of an additional 96 MMT C yr-1 from live to DOM pools which will contribute to future years reductions in the carbon sink. This future flux could be accelerated by continued increases in the turnover rate of DOM resulting from continued climate warming. Table 3.1: Average annual Fluxes of carbon resulting from land use, land-use change, and disturbances for the period 2001-2020. Emissions refer to the direct combustion of carbon to the atmosphere as either carbon monoxide, methane, or carbon dioxide. All emissions are shown in units of carbon. Harvest refers to the transfer of carbon out of the ecosystem to harvested wood products. Mortality is the transfer of live carbon to DOM pools. Transfer refers to the transfer of carbon from one DOM pool to another. Units are in MMT C yr.

By 2020, the total carbon stored in live carbon pools increased to 18,814 MMT C while DOM pools remained relatively stable. However, the net change in DOM masked dynamics within DOM pools. For example, carbon stored in standing dead snags increased by 201 MMT C while soil pools declined by -420 MMT C (Table 3.2). Net losses in biomass carbon were concentrated in three western U.S. ecoregions (Sierra Nevada Mountains, Klamath Mountains, and Cascades) resulting primarily from the cumulative effect of harvest and fire. All other ecoregions were net sinks of biomass carbon (Figure 3.3). The Idaho Batholith and Northern Rockies ecoregions were large sinks of biomass carbon resulting primarly from regrowth following high rates of historical disturbance which occured prior to 2001. Consequently, these regions also experienced significant losses in litter and deadwood pools as stocks decomposed over time.

Changes in LULC were an important driver of carbon stock change. When the effects of LULC were included in simulations, increases in live carbon were modest (2,613 MMT C) relative to simulations without LULC and disturbances (5,618 MMT C). Furthermore, changes in LULC and disturbance resulted in increases in litter and deadwood relative to simulations without LULC while soil carbon losses were larger. Results show that while climate is the primary driver of inter-annual variability in NEP and NBP, the effects of LULC and disturbance were the primary controlling process on the overall magnitude of ecosystem carbon storage and flux in the United States. Figure 3.4: Net change in carbon stocks between 2001-2020. The Clim scenario includes only the effects from climate variability and change; LULC assumes only effects from land use and disturbances; LULC+Clim includes both LULC and climate effects, and Ref assumes no effects from either LULC or climate.
