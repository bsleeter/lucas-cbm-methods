Figure 3.1 shows the estimated net primary productivity (NPP), heterotrophic respiration (Rh), net ecosystem productivity (NEP) and net biome productivity (NBP) over time for each of the four simulations. The size of the net sink varied considerably from year-to-year, ranging from -3 (source) to 242 MMT C yr-1. Climate variability was the primary driver of inter-annual variability in the size of the forest sink. When climate was not included in the simulations, the size of the net sink ranged from 51 to 200 MMT C yr-1 and showed a declining trend over time due to the lack of increased productivity from recent climate conditions. Land use, land-use change, and disturbances were the primary controlling processes effecting the magnitude of the net carbon sink. When LULC was excluded, the forest carbon sink was 49% higher (mean of 278 MMT C yr-1) than simulations where LULC was incorporated. Net primary productivity (NPP) of U.S. forests averaged 1,241 MMT C yr-1. Incorporating the effects of LULC and disturbances reduced total NPP by 50 MMT C yr-1 while incorporating the effects of climate variability and change resulted in an increase in NPP of 12 MMT C yr-1 compared to the LULC only simulation. These results suggest that LULC and disturbance have a negative impact on NPP while climate variability and change between 2001-2020 have resulted in increased productivity of U.S. forests. Heterotrophic respiration (Rh) increased under all simulations resulting from increases in productivity and climate warming. Carbon losses from LULC and disturbances reduced the annual forest carbon sink by 83 MMT C yr-1 on average. The cumulative loss of carbon sequestration was primarily from the transfer of carbon to harvest wood products which averaged 68 MMT C yr-1 while carbon losses from combusion - primarily due to wildfire - averaged 14 MMT C yr-1. In addition to ecosystem carbon removals, LULC and disturbances resulted in the transfer of an additional 96 MMT C yr-1 from live to DOM pools which will contribute to future years reductions in the carbon sink. This future flux could be accelerated by continued increases in the turnover rate of DOM resulting from continued climate warming. Figure 3.1: Net fluxes of carbon in conterminous U.S. forests for the period 2002-2020. 3.2 Carbon stocks We estimate U.S. forested ecosystems stored 52,027 MMT C in 2001 with live carbon accounting for 31% (16,201 MMT C) and DOM pools accounting for 69% (35,826 MMT C). By 2020, the total carbon stored in live carbon pools increased to 18,814 MMT C while DOM pools remained relatively stable. However, the net change in DOM masked dynamics within DOM pools. For example, carbon stored in standing dead snags increased by nearly 250 MMT C while soil pools declined by 420 MMT C (Table 3.1). Changes in LULC were an important driver of carbon stock change. When the effects of LULC were included, increases in live carbon were modest (2,613 MMT C) relative to simulations without LULC and disturbances (5,618 MMT C). Changes in LULC and disturbance resulted in increases in litter and deadwood relative to simulations without LULC while soil carbon losses were larger.
