By 2020, the total carbon stored in live carbon pools increased to 18,814 MMT C while DOM pools remained relatively stable (Table 3.2). However, the net change in DOM masked dynamics within DOM pools. For example, carbon stored in standing dead snags increased by 201 MMT C while soil pools declined by -420 MMT C (Table 3.1). Net losses in biomass carbon were concentrated in three western U.S. ecoregions (Sierra Nevada Mountains, Klamath Mountains, and Cascades) resulting primarily from the cumulative effect of harvest and fire. All other ecoregions were net sinks of biomass carbon (Figure 3.1). The Middle Rockies and Northern Rockies ecoregions were large sinks of biomass carbon resulting primarily from regrowth following high rates of historical disturbance which occurred prior to 2001. Consequently, these regions also experienced significant net declines in litter and deadwood pools as stocks decomposed over time.

Figure 3.1: Net change in carbon pools by ecoegion for the period 2001-2020. Changes in LULC were an important driver of carbon stock change. When the effects of LULC were included in simulations, increases in live carbon were modest (2,613 MMT C) relative to simulations without LULC and disturbances (5,618 MMT C). Furthermore, changes in LULC and disturbance resulted in increases in litter and deadwood relative to simulations without LULC. Wildfire and forest harvest transitions result in large fluxes of carbon from live to DOM pools, either the result of root and branch biomass left on-site after harvest or through mortality of live vegetation. The subsequent increases in DOM pools post-disturbance provide large quantities of carbon as inputs to the soil pool over time. Given the reduction of SOC input, excluding LULC/disturbance pathways from the model results in large declines in SOC relative to scenarios where LULC/disturbance are considered. In total, the inclusion of LULC/disturbances in simulations reduced the total size of the net carbon sink in the conterminous US by 55%&gt;% compared to simulations where only the effects of climate were considered. Results show that while climate was the primary driver of inter-annual variability in the annual net flux of carbon 3.3, LULC and disturbance were the primary controlling processes governing the magnitude of ecosystem carbon storage and flux in the United States. Figure 3.2: Net change in carbon stocks between 2001-2020. The Clim scenario includes only the effects from climate variability and change; LULC assumes only effects from land use and disturbances; LULC+Clim includes both LULC and climate effects, and Ref assumes no effects from either LULC or climate. 3.2 Net carbon flux For the period 2001-2020, U.S. forests were on average, a net sink of carbon at a rate of 135 MMT C yr-1. Figure 3.3 shows the estimated net primary productivity (NPP), heterotrophic respiration (Rh), net ecosystem productivity (NEP) and net biome productivity (NBP) over time for each of the four simulations. The size of the net sink varied considerably from year-to-year, ranging from -3 MMT C yr-1 (source) to 242 MMT C yr-1 (sink). Climate was the primary driver of inter-annual variability in the size of the forest sink. When climate was not included in simulations, the size of the net sink ranged from 51 to 200 MMT C yr-1 and showed a declining trend over time due to the absence of increased productivity from recent climate conditions. Land use, land-use change, and disturbances were the primary controlling processes effecting the magnitude of the net carbon sink. When LULC was excluded, the forest carbon sink was 49% higher (mean of 278 MMT C yr-1) than simulations where LULC was included. Net primary productivity (NPP) of U.S. forests averaged 1,241 MMT C yr-1. Incorporating the effects of LULC and disturbances reduced total NPP by 50 MMT C yr-1 while incorporating the effects of climate resulted in an increase in NPP of 12 MMT C yr-1 compared to the LULC only simulation. These results suggest that LULC and disturbance have a negative impact on NPP while climate variability and change between 2001-2020 have resulted in increased productivity of U.S. forests. Heterotrophic respiration (Rh) increased under all simulations resulting from increases in productivity and climate warming.

Carbon losses from LULC and disturbances reduced the annual forest carbon sink by 83 MMT C yr-1 on average. The cumulative loss of carbon sequestration was primarily from the transfer of carbon to harvested wood products (68 MMT C yr-1) with clearcut harvest accounting for more than 90% of the carbon removal from ecosystems. Harvest activities also resulted in a similar amount of carbon transferred from live to DOM pools. Ecosystem carbon losses from combustion averaged 14 MMT C yr-1, with wildfire accounting for 65% of all LULC and disturbance related emissions; emissions from urbanization and agricultural expansion accounted for 27% and 8%, respectfully. Emissions from wildfire were highly variable from year-to-year. However, the three highest fire emission years all occurred since 2017. In 2020, wildfire burned ~3,675,200 hectares, primarily in California and Oregon, an amount 246% greater than the historical average. Emissions were estimated to be 47.16 MMT C (173.06 MMT CO2), which were more then three times the historical average. In addition to ecosystem carbon removals, LULC and disturbances resulted in the transfer of an additional 96 MMT C yr-1 from live to DOM pools which will contribute to future years reductions in the carbon sink through their decay and decomposition. This future flux could be accelerated by continued increases in the turnover rate of DOM resulting from continued climate warming. Table 3.2: Average annual Fluxes of carbon resulting from land use, land-use change, and disturbances for the period 2001-2020. Emissions refer to the direct combustion of carbon to the atmosphere as either carbon monoxide, methane, or carbon dioxide. All emissions are shown in units of carbon. Harvest refers to the transfer of carbon out of the ecosystem to harvested wood products. Mortality is the transfer of live carbon to DOM pools. Transfer refers to the transfer of carbon from one DOM pool to another. Units are in MMT C yr.

We used the CanESM2 and HADGEM2-ES365 downscaled climate futures for RCP 4.5 to project changes in carbon storage and flux for U.S. forested ecosystems. Climate data from the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project (CMIP5) were downscaled using the Multivariate Adaptive Constructed Analogs (MACA) (Abatzoglou and Brown (2012)). Downscaled climate data were used to produce annual spatial flow multipliers used to scale vegetation growth and the decay and decomposition of DOM at the pixel level. MACA data were downscaled from their native ~4km resolution to 1km using a bilinear method. Future LULC and disturbances were sampled, with replacement, from historical rates of change following methods described in Benjamin M. Sleeter et al. (2019). Additional details are described in the methods section. Total ecosystem carbon storage was projected to continue to increase under both climate model simulations, with larger gains realized under the CanESM2 model as opposed to HadGEM2-ES365. However, the projected net carbon sink rate under both models was projected to be lower than that of the historical period. The "]]
